    "text": "Functions are fundamental to python, and are amongst the first features of python that most users learn. We call a function with arguments, and it returns a value. However, there is more to this callable interface than meets the eye, and there are lots of useful and powerful things we can do with the callable interface. You may have come across many of these already: (anonymous) lambda functions, the call magic method, the decorator pattern, the doc property, and modules like functools and inspect which provide detailed about functions and allow us to alter functions at runtime. The now-retired Python 3.6 release added typing annotations to this mix, and opened up a new world of metadata to use alongside your callables.\n\nLots of libraries, particularly web frameworks like Flask, Django, and FastAPI, and testing toolkits like pytest, use this callable interface to implement their API. As developers, understanding these advanced features of python’s callable interface is particularly useful when writing generic, automation focused code, and understanding how such prominent libraries work.\n\nThis talk gives a deep-dive into python functions, and the associated callable interface. We’ll start with a quick tour of the basics, before covering python’s more advanced callable features, and exploring some examples about how, why, and when you may wish to use these features yourself.",

Does your software frequently break in unexpected ways despite your testing efforts? Don’t despair! Property-based testing could be your way out of that mess. Rather than working harder and writing more test code, property-based testing forces you to work smarter and test more code with fewer tests.\n\nTraditional tests are example-based. They require the developer to come up with arbitrary inputs and check a system’s behavior against explicit outputs. More often than not, developers only think of inputs that are handled correctly by their code, thus leaving bugs hidden. Property-based tests generate the inputs for you and in many cases they’re more likely to find invalid inputs than humans. The difficulty lies in formulating these test cases.\n\nAfter this workshop you’ll be comfortable with property-based testing using Hypothesis. You’ll have experience requesting appropriate test data from Hypothesis and in writing tests for common and more advanced properties. At work, your co-workers will be impressed by your unbreakable code ;)\n\nParticipants are expected to have basic familiarity with unit testing and a testing framework.

We are thrilled to share our experience with Prefect and Dask with you. This setup allowed us to seamlessly scale our workflows in Kubernetes environment. In this talk, we compare Prefect with other popular frameworks (ease of use, unit tests, observability, …), how we approach workload management and demonstrate dev-to-production path.",

    "text": "Docker is very popular among developers and many teams use it to deliver their software. I want to use it too, but my images are large and take forever to build. Does it have to be like that? Is there a better way to do it?\n\nIn this presentation, we will go through the whole process of building a docker image for a Python web app. How to select a base image, how to optimize the size, and how to decrease the speed of build. We will think about security, logging, and caching and see how to do it all in CI. You will end up with the set of applicable best practices in creating Docker images that you can use in your projects.",

    "text": "In the last couple of years, most people have been moved to a full working from home work-style, which made us realize benefits we were not aware of, but sadly some little inconveniences as well some health related issues.\n\nSome scientific studies show that we spend over 90% of our time indoors [1]. Furthermore, advances in construction technology have caused a much better isolation, so a good ventilation is necessary. However, overventilation results in higher energy consumption usage but inadequate ventilation leads to indoor air quality that affects a person's comfort, health and even our ability to be focused and work effectively.\n\nIn order to improve my quality of life working from home, I decided to monitor and evaluate  the air of my new working place (a.k.a living room). In this talk, we will explore how to build a functional system to track the air quality, collect our own data using different sensors and implement a predictive approach to avoid future health problems.\n\nWe are going to dive into the different setups to interact with air quality sensors using Python on microcontrollers and embedded systems (Raspberry pi), collecting your own data to evaluate different factors like humidity, temperature, CO2, particles, but that’s not all, also we will go into the implementation of a predictive machine learning (ML) model to predict Indoor CO2 levels and alerting us based on predictions before critical levels.\n\nAssistants will see how Python is a great option to indoor air quality monitoring complemented with a predictive ML model for Indoor CO2, while having fun building and monitoring your home.",

They don’t understand why you need to refactor, if it already works. And when you ask, what data they need, they’ll tell you „all of them“.\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way. And I’ll show you how I solved some of the problems since I took over the team leader role in LMC 2 years ago. I’ll give you 10 tips on how organize work between data-scientists and developers and how to build a good and productive relationship.",

    "text": "We’re spoiled by the cloud. We’re so used to it that when performance problems arise, our very first thought is to scale our environment. But sometimes the best (or cheapest) option is not to increase system resources — sometimes what we need to do is dive deeply into the code and do a lot of optimization. You know, like in the old days: Just you and your profiler (and wicked amounts of caffeine).\nIn this workshop, we’ll take one of our hiring assignments that focuses on performance. We’ll look at how our candidates usually solve the task, some of the most common mistakes and misconceptions, and the best optimization strategy.\nNote: By taking part in this workshop, you'll get a good sense of what to expect in our interviews!"
